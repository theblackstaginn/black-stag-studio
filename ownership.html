      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The part nobody tells small business owners</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Most small business owners don’t actually own their website. They rent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It sounds absurd until you look at how the modern web is sold. Most “website plans”
          are subscription software, proprietary builders, or agency retainers that keep you paying
          indefinitely. If you stop paying, your site disappears. If you want to leave, you start
          over from zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s not a website. That’s a lease.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: Rental models -->
    <section class="section" id="rental">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>How rental models work</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The rental model is simple: you pay monthly, you get a page online, and you do
          <strong>not</strong> own the infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>Common rental setups include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$89/mo “marketing packages”</li>
          <li>“Free” websites tied to hosting contracts</li>
          <li>Wix / Squarespace / GoDaddy site builders</li>
          <li>Shopify storefronts that only live on their system</li>
          <li>Agency retainers with no file access</li>
          <li>Platforms with no real export path</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The symptoms are easy to spot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No access to the domain login</li>
          <li>No access to the site files</li>
          <li>No way to migrate without rebuilding</li>
          <li>No ownership of email or hosting</li>
          <li>Price hikes you can’t escape</li>
          <li>Total shutdown if you cancel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A rental website works the same way as a rented storefront: when the payments stop,
          the doors close.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: Why rental becomes a trap -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>Why rental becomes a trap</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The problem isn’t subscriptions by themselves — the problem is <strong>dependency</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you don’t own the thing that represents your business online, you don’t control
          your digital presence. That leads to real-world consequences:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can’t switch providers without rebuilding</li>
          <li>You can’t change platforms without losing everything</li>
          <li>You can’t leave an agency without going dark</li>
          <li>You can’t capture asset value when you sell</li>
          <li>You can’t protect your brand long-term</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s convenient in the beginning and expensive at the end — which is exactly how leases
          are designed.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: Ownership model -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The ownership model</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Ownership is straightforward. You own the domain, the site files, and the account where
          they live. You control access and you control when providers change.
        </p>
        <p>In practice, ownership means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can move infrastructure whenever you want</li>
          <li>No one can shut down your site over a billing dispute</li>
          <li>Your site becomes an asset, not a liability</li>
          <li>You can hire whoever you want for updates</li>
          <li>You’re not married to one platform</li>
          <li>You can sell the business with its digital property intact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The internet is land. Renting land limits sovereignty. Owning land gives you leverage.
          Same rules apply here.

    <!-- SECTION: Math -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The math over time</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Most rental models don’t look expensive until you zoom out.
        </p>
        <p>Example over 36 months:</p>
        <h3>Rental plan</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>$89/month × 36 months = <strong>$3,204</strong></li>
          <li>Plus forced updates and platform dependency</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ownership model</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Flat build fee (once)</li>
          <li>Low annual domain renewal</li>
          <li>Minimal infrastructure costs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Same outcome: a website online. Different long-term cost and control.
          Small businesses make better decisions when the math is honest.

        <h2>Why this matters for North Georgia</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Local businesses here aren’t selling software — they’re selling experiences and services.
          Their revenue depends on being found and being contacted.
        </p>
        <p>This hits especially hard for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Restaurants and food trucks</li>
          <li>Tattoo and piercing shops</li>
          <li>Hair, esthetics, and salons</li>
          <li>Contractors, builders, and trades</li>
          <li>Landscaping and pressure washing</li>
          <li>Boutiques and specialty retail</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These businesses get customers from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Maps</li>
          <li>Search</li>
          <li>Tap-to-call and tap-for-directions</li>
          <li>Local reviews</li>
          <li>Social → website handoff</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When those channels depend on rented infrastructure, the business is exposed.

    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>Quick checklist: do you own your site?</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          You can verify website ownership in under two minutes. Ask yourself:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do I have login access to my domain registrar?</li>
          <li>Do I have the actual site files or an export path?</li>
          <li>Can I move the site to a different service without rebuilding from scratch?</li>
          <li>Does my site stay online if I stop paying a specific company or agency?</li>
          <li>Can I choose who updates it?</li>
          <li>Can I sell the business with the website intact?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the answer is <strong>no</strong> to #2 or #4, you’re renting.<br />
          If the answer is <strong>no</strong> to #1, you don’t even control the land.

        <h2>Already on Wix or Squarespace? Keep your payments, own your site.</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          A lot of businesses already have payments running through Wix or Squarespace.
          That’s fine. You don’t have to burn everything down to get ownership and better usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a third option most people don’t know about:
          <strong>own the website, keep the payment platform.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Here’s how that looks in practice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your public-facing site is built the ownership way (your domain, your files, your control)</li>
          <li>Customers tap buttons on your site (tap-to-order, tap-to-book, tap-to-pay, tap-for-deposit)</li>
          <li>Those buttons route to your existing Wix/Squarespace checkout or booking page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You get:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clean, fast, mobile-first website you own</li>
          <li>Direct tap-to-order / tap-to-book functionality</li>
          <li>Zero monthly “website rental” fees</li>
          <li>Continuity with your existing payment system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This hybrid setup is ideal for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Restaurants using Wix for online ordering</li>
          <li>Food trucks routing to an existing order or pay page</li>
          <li>Tattoo shops or salons using Squarespace scheduling</li>
          <li>Boutiques using Wix or Squarespace for carts &amp; checkout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your ordering, scheduling, and payments stay exactly where they are — but your
          <strong>brand and infrastructure become yours</strong>. If you ever want to replace Wix/Squarespace
          payments entirely, you can do that later without rebuilding your whole site again.

        <p>

        <p>
          The relationship is simple:
