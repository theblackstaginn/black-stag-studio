            Most small businesses don’t own their website. They rent it.
            This page breaks down the difference, why it matters, and how I build sites
            you actually control — without losing your existing payment systems.

        <p class="section-intro">
          Most small business owners don’t actually own their website. They rent it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It sounds absurd until you look at how the modern web is sold. Most “website plans”
          are subscription software, proprietary builders, or agency retainers that keep you paying
          indefinitely. If you stop paying, your site disappears. If you want to leave, you start
          over from zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s not a website. That’s a lease.

    <!-- SECTION: Rental models -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>How rental models work</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The rental model is simple: you pay monthly, you get a page online, and you do
          <strong>not</strong> own the infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>Common rental setups include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$89/mo “marketing packages”</li>
          <li>“Free” websites tied to hosting contracts</li>
          <li>Wix / Squarespace / GoDaddy site builders</li>
          <li>Shopify storefronts that only live on their system</li>
          <li>Agency retainers with no file access</li>
          <li>Platforms with no real export path</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The symptoms are easy to spot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No access to the domain login</li>
          <li>No access to the site files</li>
          <li>No way to migrate without rebuilding</li>
          <li>No ownership of email or hosting</li>
          <li>Price hikes you can’t escape</li>
          <li>Total shutdown if you cancel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A rental website works the same way as a rented storefront: when the payments stop,
          the doors close.

        <h2>Why rental becomes a trap</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The problem isn’t subscriptions by themselves — the problem is <strong>dependency</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you don’t own the thing that represents your business online, you don’t control
          your digital presence. That leads to real-world consequences:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can’t switch providers without rebuilding</li>
          <li>You can’t change platforms without losing everything</li>
          <li>You can’t leave an agency without going dark</li>
          <li>You can’t capture asset value when you sell</li>
          <li>You can’t protect your brand long-term</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s convenient in the beginning and expensive at the end — which is exactly how leases
          are designed.

    <!-- SECTION: Ownership model -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The ownership model (how it actually works)</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Ownership is straightforward. You own the domain, the site files, and the account where
          they live. You control access and you control when providers change.
        </p>
        <p>In practice, ownership means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can move infrastructure whenever you want</li>
          <li>No one can shut down your site over a billing dispute</li>
          <li>Your site becomes an asset, not a liability</li>
          <li>You can hire whoever you want for updates</li>
          <li>You’re not married to one platform</li>
          <li>You can sell the business with its digital property intact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The internet is land. Renting land limits sovereignty. Owning land gives you leverage.
          Same rules apply here.

    <!-- SECTION: Math -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The math over time</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Most rental models don’t look expensive until you zoom out.
        </p>
        <p>Example over 36 months:</p>
        <h3>Rental plan</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>$89/month × 36 months = <strong>$3,204</strong></li>
          <li>Plus forced updates and platform dependency</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ownership model</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Flat build fee (once)</li>
          <li>Low annual domain renewal</li>
          <li>Minimal infrastructure costs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Same outcome: a website online. Different long-term cost and control.
          Small businesses make better decisions when the math is honest.

        <h2>Why this matters for North Georgia</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Local businesses here aren’t selling software — they’re selling experiences and services.
          Their revenue depends on being found and being contacted.
        </p>
        <p>This hits especially hard for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Restaurants and food trucks</li>
          <li>Tattoo and piercing shops</li>
          <li>Hair, esthetics, and salons</li>
          <li>Contractors, builders, and trades</li>
          <li>Landscaping and pressure washing</li>
          <li>Boutiques and specialty retail</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Tap-to-call and tap-for-directions</li>
          <li>Local reviews</li>
          <li>Social → website handoff</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>Quick checklist: do you own your site?</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          You can verify website ownership in under two minutes. Ask yourself:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do I have login access to my domain registrar?</li>
          <li>Do I have the actual site files or an export path?</li>
          <li>Can I move the site to a different service without rebuilding from scratch?</li>
          <li>Does my site stay online if I stop paying a specific company or agency?</li>
          <li>Can I choose who updates it?</li>
          <li>Can I sell the business with the website intact?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the answer is <strong>no</strong> to #2 or #4, you’re renting.  
          If the answer is <strong>no</strong> to #1, you don’t even control the land.

    <!-- SECTION: Hybrid Wix/Squarespace -->

      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>Already on Wix or Squarespace? Keep your payments, own your site.</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          A lot of businesses already have payments running through Wix or Squarespace.
          That’s fine. You don’t have to burn everything down to get ownership and better usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a third option most people don’t know about:
          <strong>own the website, keep the payment platform.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Here’s how that looks in practice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your public-facing site is built the ownership way (your domain, your files, your control)</li>
          <li>Customers tap buttons on your site (tap-to-order, tap-to-book, tap-to-pay, tap-for-deposit)</li>
          <li>Those buttons route to your existing Wix/Squarespace checkout or booking page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You get:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clean, fast, mobile-first website you own</li>
          <li>Direct tap-to-order / tap-to-book functionality</li>
          <li>Zero monthly “website rental” fees</li>
          <li>Continuity with your existing payment system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This hybrid setup is ideal for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Restaurants using Wix for online ordering</li>
          <li>Food trucks routing to an existing order or pay page</li>
          <li>Tattoo shops or salons using Squarespace scheduling</li>
          <li>Boutiques using Wix or Squarespace for carts &amp; checkout</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your ordering, scheduling, and payments stay exactly where they are — but your
          <strong>brand and infrastructure become yours</strong>. If you ever want to replace Wix/Squarespace
          payments entirely, you can do that later without rebuilding your whole site again.

        <h2>FAQ — ownership, rentals, and hybrid setups</h2>

        <p class="section-intro">
          A few straight answers to common questions.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Wix / Squarespace / GoDaddy “bad”?</h3>
        <p>
          Not automatically. They’re just <strong>rental platforms</strong>. They work fine for hobby sites and experiments.
          The problem for small businesses is dependency: if the platform owns the walls, you’re stuck there.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I move my Wix / Squarespace site somewhere else?</h3>
        <p>
          Not cleanly. You can usually export content (text, images), but not the actual site structure or system.
          In real terms, “moving” means rebuilding.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I stop paying my current website company or platform?</h3>
        <p>
          If your site goes dark when you stop paying, you’re renting. That’s the simplest test. Ownership means your
          business doesn’t vanish because you changed your mind about a subscription.
        </p>

        <h3>What does it actually mean to “own my site”?</h3>
        <p>
          You control the domain login, the account where the site lives, and who has access to update it. You can change
          providers without starting from scratch. It’s the difference between owning your building and renting a booth
          in someone else’s.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I still pay anything if I own my site?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, but it’s minimal and under your control: domain renewals and a small amount of infrastructure cost.
          The key difference: nobody is charging you a monthly “website fee” just to keep your name on the internet.
        </p>

        <h3>I already pay monthly right now. Does that mean I’m renting?</h3>
        <p>
          If your site disappears when you stop paying, or you can’t move it without a rebuild, you’re renting.
          Send over your domain or current provider and I’ll tell you exactly which model you’re on.
        </p>

        <h3>We already use Wix / Squarespace for online ordering. Can we keep that?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. I can build you an ownership-based main website and connect tap-to-order or tap-to-book buttons that route
          customers straight to your existing checkout or scheduling portal. You keep your payments where they are, but
          you stop renting your storefront.
        </p>

        <h3>Do we have to rebuild or migrate our orders to work with you?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The point of the hybrid model is to avoid ripping out systems that already work. We decouple the storefront
          from the merchant system so you gain control without losing functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>Who controls the accounts if I work with Black Stag Studio?</h3>
        <p>
          You do. Everything is in your name, on your logins. I’m added as a collaborator for the build and for updates.
          If you ever want to stop working with me, you keep the site and just remove my access.
        </p>

        <h3>How do updates work if I own everything?</h3>
        <p>
          Simple: you message me with what you want changed, I update the site, and you pay only for the work done.
          Think mechanic, not landlord.
        </p>

        <h3>Where will my site actually be hosted?</h3>
        <p>
          On a stable, high-availability static setup chosen to keep your costs low and your site fast. The important part:
          the account is yours, the access is yours, and there is no “website subscription” fee owed to me just to keep your
          site online.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you rescue or rebuild a site someone else made?</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes we can migrate; often it makes more sense to rebuild clean on infrastructure you control.
          The goal is the same either way: after we’re done, you’re not stuck.
        </p>

        <h3>How much does a real, owned website cost with you?</h3>
        <p>
          Most projects land between $250 and $1000 depending on scope. It’s a flat build fee, plus the low ongoing costs
          you’d pay no matter what (domain, basic infrastructure). No retainer, no mystery bills.
        </p>

        <h3>Why does any of this matter for a small local business?</h3>
        <p>
          Because your online presence isn’t fluff anymore — it’s infrastructure. When your leads, reviews, and directions
          all rely on a digital storefront, that storefront should belong to you.
