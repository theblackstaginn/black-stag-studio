        <h2>General ownership questions</h2>

        <p class="section-intro">
          If you haven’t read it yet, the full
          <a href="ownership.html">Website Ownership vs Rental</a> page gives the big picture.
          These answers zoom in on specifics.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Wix / Squarespace / GoDaddy “bad”?</h3>
        <p>
          Not automatically. They’re just <strong>rental platforms</strong>. They work fine for hobby sites and experiments.
          The problem for small businesses is dependency: if the platform owns the walls, you’re stuck there.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I move my Wix / Squarespace site somewhere else?</h3>
        <p>
          Not cleanly. You can usually export content (text, images), but not the actual site structure or system.
          In real terms, “moving” means rebuilding.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I stop paying my current website company or platform?</h3>
        <p>
          If your site goes dark when you stop paying, you’re renting. That’s the simplest test. Ownership means your
          business doesn’t vanish because you changed your mind about a subscription.
        </p>

        <h3>What does it actually mean to “own my site”?</h3>
        <p>
          You control the domain login, the account where the site lives, and who has access to update it. You can change
          providers without starting from scratch. It’s the difference between owning your building and renting a booth
          in someone else’s.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I still pay anything if I own my site?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, but it’s minimal and under your control: domain renewals and a small amount of infrastructure cost.
          The key difference: nobody is charging you a monthly “website fee” just to keep your name on the internet.

        <h2>Platform &amp; pricing questions</h2>

        <h3>I already pay monthly right now. Does that mean I’m renting?</h3>
        <p>
          If your site disappears when you stop paying, or you can’t move it without a rebuild, you’re renting.
          Send over your domain or current provider and I’ll tell you exactly which model you’re on.
        </p>

        <h3>How much does a real, owned website cost with you?</h3>
        <p>
          Most projects land between $250 and $1000 depending on scope. It’s a flat build fee, plus the low ongoing costs
          you’d pay no matter what (domain, basic infrastructure). No retainer, no mystery bills.
        </p>

        <h3>Why don’t you charge a monthly “management” fee?</h3>
        <p>
          Because that turns your website into a lease. I’d rather you own the property and pay me like a mechanic:
          only when you actually need work done.

        <h2>Hybrid setups (Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, etc.)</h2>

        <h3>We already use Wix / Squarespace for online ordering. Can we keep that?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. I can build you an ownership-based main website and connect tap-to-order or tap-to-book buttons that route
          customers straight to your existing checkout or scheduling portal. You keep your payments where they are, but
          you stop renting your storefront.
        </p>

        <h3>Do we have to rebuild or migrate our orders to work with you?</h3>
        <p>
          No. The point of the hybrid model is to avoid ripping out systems that already work. We decouple the storefront
          from the merchant system so you gain control without losing functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>What about Shopify?</h3>
        <p>
          Shopify is a powerful rental ecosystem for ecommerce. For some online stores, that trade-off is fine. For many
          local service businesses, it’s unnecessary overhead. We can talk through whether it actually fits what you’re doing.

        <h2>Working with Black Stag Studio</h2>

        <h3>Who controls the accounts if I work with you?</h3>
        <p>
          You do. Everything is in your name, on your logins. I’m added as a collaborator for the build and for updates.
          If you ever want to stop working with me, you keep the site and just remove my access.
        </p>

        <h3>How do updates work if I own everything?</h3>
        <p>
          Simple: you message me with what you want changed, I update the site, and you pay only for the work done.
          Think mechanic, not landlord.
        </p>

        <h3>Can you rescue or rebuild a site someone else made?</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes we can migrate; often it makes more sense to rebuild clean on infrastructure you control.
          The goal is the same either way: after we’re done, you’re not stuck.
        </p>

        <h3>Why does any of this matter for a small local business?</h3>
        <p>
          Because your online presence isn’t fluff anymore — it’s infrastructure. When your leads, reviews, and directions
          all rely on a digital storefront, that storefront should belong to you.
