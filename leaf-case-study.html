          <p>
            A simple, mobile-first one-page website with tap-to-call ordering and a readable menu
            for a grocery and deli in White County, Georgia.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-tagline">
            Business type: Grocery + deli with hot food service · Location: Cleveland, GA (White County)

        <h2>The situation</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Leaf had strong local foot traffic and great food, but no website — just a Facebook page.
        </p>
        <p>
          That meant customers had no easy way to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>See the menu on their phone</li>
          <li>Call in orders quickly</li>
          <li>Get directions via Google Maps</li>
          <li>Check store hours at a glance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During busy times, customers were digging through old posts, messaging the page,
          or dialing the wrong number. The food was great, but the path to ordering was full of friction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The constraints</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The owner did not want subscriptions, dashboards, or a complicated online ordering system.
        </p>
        <p>
          They needed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A readable menu on phones</li>
          <li>A tap-to-call button for orders</li>
          <li>Tap-for-directions via Google Maps</li>
          <li>Branding that matched the store’s feel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal was simple: make it easy for hungry people to see what’s cooking and call in an order
          without getting lost in social media.
        </p>

        <h2>The build</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          I built a lightweight, custom-coded one-page site focused on speed and clarity.
        </p>
        <p>The site includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tap-to-call ordering button pinned in the hero</li>
          <li>Menu sections for breakfast and lunch service</li>
          <li>Store hours and address</li>
          <li>Tap-for-directions button that opens Google Maps</li>
          <li>Clean, understated styling that fits the shop</li>
          <li>No monthly software or “website rental” fees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Everything is static HTML/CSS — fast to load, inexpensive to run, and completely under the owner’s control.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The result</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Customers can now get what they need in a few seconds instead of fighting algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>Practically, this means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customers can read the menu without zooming or scrolling through old posts</li>
          <li>Ordering happens with a single tap on the call button</li>
          <li>New customers can tap for directions instead of typing the address</li>
          <li>Hours and offerings are visible at a glance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It removed friction between hungry customers and hot food — exactly what a local grocery and deli needs
          during breakfast and lunch rushes.
        </p>

        <h2>Ownership and cost structure</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Leaf didn’t sign up for a new subscription. They bought a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the Black Stag model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The client controls the domain and hosting</li>
          <li>There are no monthly “website rental” fees</li>
          <li>I’m added as a collaborator for updates — like a mechanic, not a landlord</li>
          <li>The site becomes digital property that can move with the business</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This same pattern works for restaurants, food trucks, salons, tattoo studios, and any small business
          in North Georgia that needs practical online infrastructure instead of another app to babysit.

          gets people fed, booked, or on the schedule, we can use the same playbook.
