            A fast one-page site with tap-to-call ordering, directions, hours, and a readable menu
            built to remove friction for local customers.

        <h2>The situation</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Leaf had strong local foot traffic and great food, but no website, just a Facebook page.
        </p>
        <p>
          That meant customers had no easy way to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>See the menu on their phone</li>
          <li>Call in orders quickly</li>
          <li>Get directions via Google Maps</li>
          <li>Check store hours at a glance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During busy times, customers were digging through old posts, messaging the page,
          or dialing the wrong number. The food was great, but the path to ordering was full of friction.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The constraints</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The owner did not want subscriptions, dashboards, or a complicated online ordering system.
        </p>
        <p>
          They needed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A readable menu on phones</li>
          <li>A tap-to-call button for orders</li>
          <li>Tap-for-directions via Google Maps</li>
          <li>Branding that matched the store’s feel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal was simple: make it easy for hungry people to see what is cooking and call in an order
          without getting lost in social media.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The build</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          I built a lightweight, custom-coded one-page site focused on speed and clarity.
        </p>
        <p>The site includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tap-to-call ordering button pinned in the hero</li>
          <li>Menu sections for breakfast and lunch service</li>
          <li>Store hours and address</li>
          <li>Tap-for-directions button that opens Google Maps</li>
          <li>Clean, understated styling that fits the shop</li>
          <li>No monthly software or website rental fees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Everything is static HTML and CSS. Fast to load, inexpensive to run, and completely under the owner’s control.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>The result</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Customers can now get what they need in a few seconds instead of fighting algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>Practically, this means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customers can read the menu without zooming or scrolling through old posts</li>
          <li>Ordering happens with a single tap on the call button</li>
          <li>New customers can tap for directions instead of typing the address</li>
          <li>Hours and offerings are visible at a glance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It removed friction between hungry customers and hot food. Exactly what a local deli needs
          during breakfast and lunch rushes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>Ownership and cost structure</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Leaf did not sign up for a new subscription. They bought a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the Black Stag model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The client controls the domain and hosting</li>
          <li>There are no monthly website rental fees</li>
          <li>I am added as a collaborator for updates, like a mechanic, not a landlord</li>
          <li>The site becomes digital property that can move with the business</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This same pattern works for restaurants, food trucks, salons, tattoo studios, and any small business
          in North Georgia that needs practical online infrastructure instead of another app to babysit.
